# discord-simc-bot
A Discord bot that requests simulations of World of Warcraft characters via message queue, based on discord-py.

There are two components:
 1. the Discord bot that handles Discord requests, publishes simc msgs and receives simc responses.
 2. a python process that receives simc requests, executes simc and returns results.
